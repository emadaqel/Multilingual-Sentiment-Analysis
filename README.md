This project focuses on performing multilingual sentiment analysis on healthcare-related patient feedback written in English and Arabic. The dataset consists of textual reviews collected from a healthcare opinions website, where each record contains an English version of the review and its corresponding Arabic translation. The primary objective of the project is to automatically determine the sentiment expressed in each sentence as positive, neutral, or negative.

To achieve this, the project follows a rule-based and transformer-based natural language processing pipeline. First, the reviews are segmented into individual sentences using language-specific sentence tokenization techniques. English sentences are segmented using the NLTK sentence tokenizer, while Arabic sentences are segmented using a simple punctuation-based approach. Each sentence is then analyzed independently.

Sentiment classification is performed using a pre-trained multilingual transformer model (nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment) from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model assigns a star rating (from 1 to 5) to each sentence, which is subsequently mapped into three sentiment categories: negative, neutral, and positive. The confidence score produced by the model is interpreted as the model’s certainty in its prediction rather than the strength of the sentiment.

No model training or fine-tuning is conducted in this project. Instead, a pre-trained model is used directly for inference to ensure simplicity, reproducibility, and consistency across languages. The final output of the pipeline is a sentence-level sentiment label for both English and Arabic text, enabling comparative sentiment analysis across languages within the same dataset.
